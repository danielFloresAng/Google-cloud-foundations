<!-- what's the cloud? -->
Cloud computing is a way of using IT that has these five equally important traits"
1.- Customers get computing resources that are on-demand and self-service
2.- Get access to those resources over the internet, from anywhere
3.- The provider of those resources allocates them to users out of that pool
4.- The resources are elastic-which means they can increase or decrease as needed
5.- Customers pay only for what they use, or reserve as they go
