<!-- what's the cloud? -->
Cloud computing is a way of using IT that has these five equally important traits"
1.- Customers get computing resources that are on-demand and self-service
2.- Get access to those resources over the internet, from anywhere
3.- The provider of those resources allocates them to users out of that pool
4.- The resources are elastic-which means they can increase or decrease as needed
5.- Customers pay only for what they use, or reserve as they go

 Components:
- Users
- Applications
- Infrastructure


// IaaS, PaaS and SaaS

- IaaS: Infrastructure as a service
- PaaS: Platform as a service
- ISaaS: Software as a service 


// Google cloud Infrastructure are based on three layers

1- Networking and security
2- Compute and storage
3- Big data and ML products

* Google cloud computing Services:
  - Compute engine
  - Google kubernets engine
  - App engine
  - Cloud functions
  - Cloud run

* Google cloud storage services: 
  - Cloud storage
  - Cloud SQL
  - Cloud spanner
  - Cloud Bigtable
  - Firestore





// Cloud functions
  Is serverless code that let you run it based on certain events

//Google kubernetes engine (GKE)
  provides a managed environment for deploying, managing, and scaling your containerized applications using Google infrastructure. The GKE environment consists of multiple machines (specifically Compute Engine instances) grouped to form a container cluster.

//Gloud Run
  Manage compute platform that less run stateless containers by using web request or Pub sub events. Is serverless

Google cloud run workflow is a three-steps process:
  - Write the application code
  - Build and packege the application into a container image
  - Deploy the container image to cloud run
